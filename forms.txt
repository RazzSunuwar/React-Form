React Forms

Just like in HTML, React uses forms to allow users to interact with web pages.


Adding Forms in React

You add a form with React like any other element:


Handling forms

Handling forms is about how you handle the data when it changes value or gets submitted.

In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM.

In React, form data is usually handled by the components.

When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state.

You can control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange attribute:


Conditonal Rendering
If you do not want to display the h1 element until the user has done any input, you can add an if
statement.

Look at the example below and note the following:

1. We create an empty variable, in this example we call it header.

2. We add an if statement to insert content to the header variable if the user has done any input.

3. We insert the header variable in the output, using curly brackets.


Submitting forms
You can control the submit action by adding an event handler in the onSubmit attribute:


Mulltiple Input Fields
You can control the values of more than one input field by adding a name attribute to each element.

When you initialize the state in the constructor, use the field names.

To access the fields in the event handler use the event.target.name and event.target.value syntax.

To update the state in the this.setState method, use square brackets [bracket notation] around the
property name.


Validating Form Input
You can validate form input when the user is typing or you can wait until the form gets submitted.
